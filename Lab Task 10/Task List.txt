1. Write a program to create one interface “Employee” with attributes of an employee like id,
name, age, and salary also it contains a method salary(). In the child clas implement the interface
to print all details of the employee by calling salary().
2. Write a program to handle divide by zero exception using try and catch block.
3. Write a program to handle Array index out of bound exception if there are 3 elements in an array
A and we want to print A[5] using try and catch block?
4. Write a program to show multiple catch blocks with exception classes:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException and Exception (generic class) for handling the exception divide
by zero case.
5. Write a program to create a class X with a method Y() to throw one exception
ArithmeticException with message “Exception is Thrown”, handle it and then call the method to
show the message in main method.
6. Write a program to create a class X with a method Z() to create a list of probable exception:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException using throws. Inside Z() throw this exception with message
“test exception”. Then call the method Z() in try block and handle it (in main method).
7. Write a program using finally block to print the average of 5 numbers using for loop. Before
that show an exception in try block (divide by zero) which is not handled using any catch block.
