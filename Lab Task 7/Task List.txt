                                     Lab Work
1. Write a program to create a class “University” with a variable “name” and method
“University()” (as constructor) to assign and printing the name (university). Create a child class
“College” with same name variable “name” and method name “College()” (as constructor). In
College(), call parent class University() (using Super() ), then assign and print college name.
Using obj. of child class, access the method of the child class to print university and college
names.
2. Write a program using Method Overloading (Static Polymorphism) to overload display() for
printing an integer, a float, a double, and a character? (Pass the values as arguments to the
display() from main method).
3. Write a program using Method Overriding (Run time Polymorphism/dynamic method
dispatching) to override Purpose() for Parent Class “Defence”. It has three child class “Navy”,
“Airforce”, and “Army”? Create objects of each class in class main and access the Purpose()
respectively to print the purpose of the defence class element (navy,airforce,army).
